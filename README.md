## 👋 About Me

I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** with **6+ years of combined professional and freelance experience** building mobile applications, backend systems, and digital products used by real users.

I’ve worked with **3 local software firms**, **international freelance clients**, and **remote teams**, contributing to apps that are live on the **Google Play Store and Apple App Store**.

Most commercial projects are under **NDA**, so this GitHub focuses on **architecture, engineering practices, and feature-level implementations** that reflect how I build real products.
